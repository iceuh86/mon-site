This project is a web application that replicates the classic space strategy game OGame. It is built using React for the client-side and Node.js for the server-side.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Client**: The front-end of the application built with React.
- **Server**: The back-end of the application built with Node.js and Express.

## Features

- User authentication (login and registration)
- Game management (create and manage planets, buildings, and resources)
- Real-time game interactions
